# ld40
I basically duplicated my whole [steering sandbox repo](https://github.com/taylorvance/steering-sandbox) :\ I panicked before I could figure out how to fork just upload the ludum branch to the original or whatever.

I started the [LD40 compo](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/mo-gold-mo-dragons) with my homemade [vector](https://github.com/tvance989/vector-js) and [vehicle](https://github.com/tvance989/vehicle-js) libraries and html5 game engine.
I made the game logic, art, and music myself from scratch after the compo started.

Files of note:
* main.js (game engine)
* demo.js (game logic)
* index.html (game canvas and UI)
